Chapter 1

==

You can compile and run your code on most machines using this trick:

gcc zork.c -o zork && ./zork

&& here means “and then if it’s successful, do this…”

This command will run the new program only if it compiles successfully. If there’s a problem with the compile, it will skip running the program and simply display the errors on the screen.
